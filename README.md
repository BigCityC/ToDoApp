#ABOUT

This application is hosted with AWS Amplify and can be found here https://www.bigcitycode.org/.
 
I set out to build a todo list that I would want to use in my daily life. It's easy to use, and has a simple UI.
Through creating this application, I learned the basics of React components, specifically functional components.
The tools that I used to implement this project were Create-React-App, HTML/CSS, JSX, and Amplify.
I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time into understanding core concepts of React.
