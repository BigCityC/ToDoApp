Reflection  
I set out to build a todo list that I would want to use in my daily life. It's easy to use, and has a simple UI.
The challenges I faced with this project is learning to understand the basics of React components, specifically functional components.
Some unexpected obstacles were understanding React LifeCycles and how states and props work within the components.
The tools that I used to implement this project were Create-React-App, HTML/CSS, JSX, and Amplify. This was my first React project, so I wanted to keep it simple to get 
the basics down before moving on to more complex tools.
I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time into understanding core concepts of React.
